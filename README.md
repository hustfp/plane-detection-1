# Fast dominant plane segmentation algorithm for MATLAB

A plane detection method based on depth information from a Kinect camera. The plane parameters are obtained by segmentation in normal space followed by refinement in distance space. 

+ Depth registration aligns depth and color data
+ Segmentation in normal space
+ Refinement in distance space
+ The obtained plane parameters are used to segment objects
