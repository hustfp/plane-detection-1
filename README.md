# Fast dominant plane segmentation algorithm for MATLAB

A plane detection method based on depth information from a Kinect camera. The plane parameters are obtained by segmentation in normal space followed by refinement in distance space. Objects are segmented by evaluation of all points above the found plane parameters.
